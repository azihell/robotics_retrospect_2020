This report sums up the results of the projects executed along the duration of the graduation course in Robotics and Autonomous Systems. The
course embraced 12 graduates from the Electric, Mechanic, Computer and Control and Automation engineering fields and trained them in using CAD tools for object modelling, simulation tools for physics and environments, project management, software development in Python, C++ (specially for ROS) and R languages, as well as version management. These tools were gradually learned so that they would be used in assembling a robotic manipulator and setting up a mobile platform that was used in autonoums mapping and exploring, besides the manipulation. The projects were fashioned so the graduates capacities would be complimentary, having present always the figure of a project leader.
